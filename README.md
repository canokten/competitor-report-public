# Competitor Analysis SaaS Prototype (Hair Salons in Vancouver)

*A data engineering + analytics project built on Databricks with Google Maps data integration*

---

## Overview
This project is a **Competitor Analysis SaaS prototype** designed to help local businesses understand their competitive landscape.  
The demo case focuses on **hair salons in Vancouver**, but the system is **sector-agnostic** (extendable to restaurants, tattoo shops, bars, etc.).

The solution combines **data extraction, ETL pipelines, analytics modeling, and interactive dashboards**, all embedded into a shareable **HTML report** for end users.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Data Extraction**: [Apify](https://apify.com/) (Google Maps scraper),  [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview)
- **Data Engineering**: [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/)  
  - Delta Lake  
  - SQL Warehouses  
  - Python Notebooks  
  - Medallion Architecture (Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold)
- **Analytics & Modeling**:
  - Custom KPIs (`rating_score = rating Ã— log(reviews)`)
  - LLM-based sentiment analysis (praise/complaint categories)
- **Visualization**: Databricks **Lakeview Dashboards**
- **Reporting**: Custom **HTML embedding** of dashboards
- **Other Skills**: ETL, JSON handling, data cleaning, review normalization, competitor mapping

## Data Pipeline (Medallion Architecture)

1. **Bronze Layer**  
   - Ingest raw Google Maps JSON (places, reviews, services) and Apify reviews JSON.

2. **Silver Layer**  
   - Normalize entities: `places_info`, `places_ratings`, `places_reviews`.  
   - Handle missing values, deduplicate records, standardize coordinates using geomap data.

3. **Gold Layer**  
   - Create **analytics-ready tables**.  
   - KPIs:
     - Average rating and densities by neighborhood  
     - Competitor density maps 
     - Review sentiment breakdown (praise vs complaint categories)  
     - **Weighted score metric** (`rating Ã— log(1 + reviews)`)

---

## Visualizations & Reporting
All visuals were built in **Databricks Lakeview** and embedded into an **HTML report** for easy sharing.  

Key sections of the report:
- **Executive Summary**: KPIs & weighted scores
- **Competitor Density**: By neighborhood and map-based
- **Ratings & Reviews**: Distributions, averages, and trends
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Top complaint/praise categories

---

## Key Features
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: From raw Google Maps data â†’ insights in a dashboard  
- **Custom Metrics**: Weighted scores, density calculations, LLM sentiment categories  
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Embedded directly into a shareable HTML report  
- **Scalable**: Built on Databricks medallion architecture and Delta Lake  

---

## Access & Limitations
- Review data was collected using **Apify Google Maps scrapers** (limited by free-tier quota).  
- **Lakeview dashboards** require proper **service principal permissions** if replicated.
- Can be **Sector-Agnostic**: Pipeline can work for restaurants, clothing stores, tattoo shops, and more (free-tier quoats limits the report to be only hair salon's in Vancouver)

---

## Future Improvements
- Add **scheduled ingestion** to keep data up-to-date (Airflow/Databricks Jobs).  
- Extend to **multi-city, multi-sector monitoring** using paid-tier accounts for tools.
- Enhance **review sentiment model** with fine-tuned LLM (more insights can be generated depending on client needs).
